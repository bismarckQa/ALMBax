Acceptance Criteria â€“ Feature: Generate a Notification HD Prescription
The user must be able to configure the notification profile to generate alerts for new or modified HD prescriptions.

When a new HD prescription is created and the notification profile is active, a notification (bell icon) must increment.

When a prescription is modified, and notifications are enabled, the bell icon must also increment.

If the notification profile is disabled, creating a new HD prescription must not trigger a notification.

The notification indicator (bell icon) must clearly reflect the number of new alerts.
