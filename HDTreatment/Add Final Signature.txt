Acceptance Criteria â€“ Feature: Add Final Signature
The system must enforce required fields only at the moment of finalizing the treatment.

Users with different roles (e.g., nephrologist, nurse) must be able to add a final signature if their role allows it.

Once a treatment is finalized and signed, the system must enable read-only mode for that record.

If there are changes to prescription fields during treatment, they must be shown in the final notes.

The nurse profile must be able to finalize treatment if the nephrologist signature is not required by configuration.

 Expected Results per Scenario
Scenario: Adapt the functionality of the required field configuration only for the treatment finalization
The system enforces completion of required fields only when attempting to finish the treatment. If any required field is missing, the user is notified and cannot finalize.

Scenario: Add final signature with Nephrologist profile
A user with the nephrologist profile signs the treatment. The final signature is registered and visible in the treatment summary.

Scenario: Add final signature with Nephrologist profile (finalized treatment)
After finalizing the treatment, the system sets the treatment to read-only mode. No further modifications are allowed.

Scenario: Show an extract of the prescription changes of the treatment on the final notes
Any prescription fields changed during the treatment are listed in the final notes section upon finalization.

Scenario: Add final signature with nurse profile
The nurse profile finalizes the treatment without the nephrologist signature (as it's not required). The treatment is closed, and the system records it as valid.
