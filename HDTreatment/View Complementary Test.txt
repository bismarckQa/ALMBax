Acceptance Criteria ‚Äì Feature: View Complementary Test
The system must support automatic filtering of complementary tests when accessed from related modules (e.g., Accesses).

When a new complementary test is added while a relation (like Access) is active, it must be assigned automatically or manually to that relation.

The filter menu must allow filtering by category.

If no filter is selected, the system must show all complementary tests for the patient.

After deleting related Accesses, all related complementary tests must be removable.

üîé Expected Results per Scenario
Scenario: Automatic filter of Complementary Tests from Access section
The test is created and associated with an access. When navigating through ‚ÄúSee Further Test‚Äù > ‚ÄúAttached Test‚Äù, the system automatically filters and shows only the linked test.

Scenario: In Compl. Tests, while the section is filtered by relationship, the new Compl. Tests should be assigned to the relation if requested: from Access
The new test is created and linked to the access while the section is filtered. The test is successfully assigned, and the filter reflects it properly.

Scenario: Automatic filter of Complementary Tests from Access section (category filter)
When the user filters by a specific category (e.g., ‚Äúcategory test 1‚Äù), only complementary tests from that category are shown. The filter works as expected.

Scenario: Without filtering Complementary Tests by its Categories
If the user does not select any filter, the system shows all complementary tests associated with the patient.

Scenario: Delete data created of Accesses and Additional studies
The user deletes the Access entry (with credentials/password). After this, all previously created complementary tests related to it are deleted successfully.
