Acceptance Criteria – Feature: Add New Additional Signature
When a nurse finalizes a treatment, the system must automatically fill the "Signed by" field in the "Additional Signatures" section.

If a treatment is finalized, it must enter read-only mode, showing the Final and Additional signatures.

If the nephrologist's signature is required and missing, the system must show an alert and block finalization.

Expected Results per Scenario
Scenario: Check whether in the HD Treatment tab, the field "signed by" in the "additional signatures" section is filled if the user is a nurse
When the nurse creates and finalizes the treatment, the system automatically fills the "Signed by" field with the nurse’s information in the "Additional Signatures" section.

Scenario: Add additional signature (Finalized treatment Nurse profile)
After finalizing the treatment, the nurse sees the treatment in read-only mode, with the "Final Signature" and "Additional Signatures" displayed correctly.

Scenario: Add additional signature (finalized treatment nephrologist profile)
The nephrologist tries to finalize the treatment without adding their required signature.
The system blocks the action and displays an alert:
