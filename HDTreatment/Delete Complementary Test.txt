Acceptance Criteria â€“ Feature: Delete Complementary Test
The user must be able to delete a complementary test when there is no relation with other modules.

If the user cancels the deletion, the test must remain intact.

If the test is related to Access, Waiting List, or Hospitalization, the system must block the deletion and show a warning alert.

Once the related data is deleted (Access/Waiting List/Hospitalization), the system must allow the test to be deleted.

Confirmation dialogs must appear when attempting deletions, and user responses must be respected (Yes/No).

The system must correctly reflect the deletion in the UI and database.
