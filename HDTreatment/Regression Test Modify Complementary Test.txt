Acceptance Criteria – Feature: Regression Test Modify Complementary Test
The system must allow users to edit complementary tests and save the changes successfully.

If the user cancels an edit, the original data must remain unchanged.

If a required field (e.g., Date of Record) is removed, the Save button must be hidden to block invalid submissions.

After logging out and back in, edits must persist only if saved.

Users must be able to validate server functionality to ensure that data creation and update operations work correctly across patient groups.

🔎 Expected Results per Scenario
Scenario: Canceling an edited complementary test
The user edits the test but cancels the operation. After logout and login, the original values remain. The new data (QATestEdit) is not saved. The test is then deleted successfully.

Scenario: Edit a complementary test with empty required fields
The user deletes a required field (e.g., Date of Record). The Save button does not appear.
After logout/login, the original test remains unchanged, confirming the edit was not applied. The test is deleted afterward.

Scenario: Successful edited complementary test
The user edits the test with a new reception date and description (QATestEdit).
After logout and login, the updated values are displayed. The test is then deleted successfully.

Scenario: Check the Server Functionality to CREATE data in Complementary Test
A test is added and later edited by a user in the “Pacientes en HD” group.
The updated test (QATestEdit) is retrieved correctly after logout/login.
This confirms the backend supports create + edit + persist actions. The test is deleted afterward.
