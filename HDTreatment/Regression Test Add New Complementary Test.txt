Acceptance Criteria â€“ Feature: Regression Test Add New Complementary Test
The user must be able to add a new complementary test by entering valid required data.

The system must allow cancelling the creation of a test without saving any data.

If required fields are missing (e.g., test field), the Save button must not be available.

After a successful creation, the complementary test must appear in the list and be deletable.

The backend must support creating and persisting test records correctly (server functionality).

 Expected Results per Scenario
Scenario: Canceling an added complementary test
The user fills in the data but cancels the creation before saving. The test is not created or listed. A check confirms that no record has been added.

Scenario: Successful Added Complementary Tests
The user fills in the required data and saves the test. It appears in the list with the correct description. The user deletes it successfully afterward.

Scenario: Add a complementary test with empty required fields
The user omits a required field (e.g., test type). The system does not display the Save button, preventing incomplete submissions.

Scenario: Check the Server Functionality to CREATE data in Complementary Test
Using a different user group ("Pacientes en HD"), the user adds and saves a test. The system confirms it was created successfully. It is then deleted as part of the cleanup.
