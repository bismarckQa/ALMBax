 Acceptance Criteria â€“ Feature: Delete Complementary Test
The user must be able to add, delete, or cancel the deletion of a complementary test.

If a complementary test is linked to other modules (Accesses, Waiting List, Hospitalization), a warning must block the deletion.

A test must only be deleted if it is not linked or if the dependency is removed first.

Canceling a delete operation should leave the data intact.

Once dependent data (Access, Waiting List, or Hospitalization) is deleted, the test can be deleted.

The system must show confirmation and warning messages accordingly.
