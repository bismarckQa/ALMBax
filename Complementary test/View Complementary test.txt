Acceptance Criteria ‚Äì Feature: View Complementary Test
The user must be able to view complementary tests filtered by related modules like Accesses and Categories.

When accessing complementary tests through Accesses, only those related should be automatically shown.

New complementary tests created while a filter is active must be linked to that relation (e.g., Access).

Users must be able to filter complementary tests by specific categories.

When no filter is applied, the system must display all complementary tests for the patient.

The system must support deletion of both Access and associated complementary tests after confirmation.

üîé Expected Results per Scenario
Scenario: Automatic filter of Complementary Tests from Access section
The complementary test added previously is displayed automatically when accessed from the Access section via ‚ÄúSee Further Test‚Äù. The filter works correctly and shows only the associated test.

Scenario: In Compl. Tests, while the section is filtered by relationship, the new Compl. Tests should be assigned to the relation if requested: from Access
The new test is saved and correctly linked to the currently active Access. The association is confirmed through the UI.

Scenario: Automatic filter of Complementary Tests by category
When filtering by a specific category (e.g., category test 1), only tests under that category are shown. The filter applies as expected.

Scenario: Without filtering Complementary Tests by its Categories
If no filter is selected, all complementary tests for the patient are displayed in the list.

Scenario: Delete data created of Accesses and Additional studies
After entering the correct password, the Access is deleted. Then, all associated complementary tests are deleted successfully from the Complementary tests module.
