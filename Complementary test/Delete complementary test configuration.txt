Feature: Delete Complementary Test

Acceptance Criteria:
- The user can access the user configuration module and view the list of configured complementary (supplementary) tests.
- The user can attempt to delete a complementary test and cancel the action, resulting in the test remaining unchanged.
- The user can successfully delete a complementary test that is not linked or referenced.
- The user cannot delete a complementary test that is being referenced by other modules; the system must block the deletion and display an appropriate warning.
